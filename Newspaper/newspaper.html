                <p>“Mr. Attorney General, please use your good offices to see what happened. Somebody who appears in this court is suspended. Talk to the Lieutenant Governor… If there is some other reason, apart from his appearance in this court, that’s different… But this suspension happens in close succession to his appearance before us… just see what happened,” Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud addressed the country’s top law officer R. Venkataramani.

                    The Supreme Court on August 28 asked the Attorney General of India to look into the suspension of a senior Kashmiri lecturer, Zaroor Ahmed Bhat, from his job by the Jammu and Kashmir administration in close succession of his arguing his challenge to the abrogation of Article 370 before the top court.

                    “I have not seen the order, but the timing and the reference to this aspect [Mr. Bhat’s appearance in the Supreme Court in the Article 370 case]... If it is there, then there is a little problem,” Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul joined in from the Bench.
                    
                    Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for both the Union of India and the Jammu and Kashmir administration, said “there are other issues” leading to the suspension and everything in the newspapers “may not be the whole truth” about the affair.
                    
                    However, when the judges on the Constitution Bench, one after the other, voiced their scepticism about the suspiciously quick succession of events, Mr. Mehta admitted that the “timing was definitely not proper… I bow down… no argument”. He said he would ask the government officials concerned to look into it.</p>

                    Mr. Bhat’s predicament was brought to the attention of the Bench by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Rajiv Dhavan, who said “this is not the way our democracy functions. He appears in this court, files written submissions, the next day he is suspended”.
                    
                    Mr. Sibal said if there were “other issues” which prompted the suspension, the administration could have acted against him earlier. “Why wait till he appears in the Article 370 matter,” the senior advocate asked.
                    
                    “He was suspended from the faculty because he argued what he argued in the Article 370 matter… these things should not happen,” Mr. Sibal submitted.</p>

            </h4>
            <p>
                Provisional statistics from the Life Insurance Council state that the Life Insurance industry in India has marked a 27% decline year on year (YoY) basis in new business premiums (NBP) to Rs 27,867 crore in July 2023. Although private insurance companies are still on the growth path, there’s a dip in their pace, compared to last year. NBP touched Rs 12,481 crore in July this year, a 25% increase YoY and 4% higher sequentially. More worrying is the fact that this overall slowdown has occurred despite a 2% hike in the total number of policies sold. Besides, the absolute revenue has dropped by 25% sequentially. On an annualised premium equivalent (APE) basis as well, there has been a dip of 0.5% from the July 2022 figures. This has resulted in the single lump sum premium figures matching with the non-single or regular premium received over a stipulated term. </p>

            <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin will not participate in the G20 leaders’ summit to be held here during September 9-10, the Press Secretary to the Russian President Dmitry Peskov has informed the Russian media. Friday’s announcement is in line with other recent international summits held after the beginning of the Ukraine crisis in February 2022, where Mr. Putin has remained absent. He was earlier expected to travel to Turkey at the invitation of President  Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the latest announcement has cast a shadow on this expected visit as well.  </p>
